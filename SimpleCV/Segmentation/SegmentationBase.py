    Right now I am going to keep this class as brain dead and single threaded as
    possible just so I can get the hang of abc in python. The idea behind a segmentation
    object is that you pass it frames, it does some sort of operations and you
    get a foreground / background segemnted image. Eventually I would like
    these processes to by asynchronous and multithreaded so that they can raise
    specific image processing events.
