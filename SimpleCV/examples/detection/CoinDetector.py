'''
This example finds a quarter in the picture and then uses that measurement
to determine the rest of the coins in the picture.  Since a quarter is always
a certain size we can use it as a reference because it is known.

In this example we use millimeters to pixels to do the conversion.

The sizes of coins are as follows:
penny - 19.05 mm
nickel - 21.21 mm
dime - 17.9 mm
quarter - 24.26 mm

#Here we compute the scale factor

    diameter = c.radius() * 2
    sizeRatio = quarterSize / diameter

#Now we print the measurements back on the picture
for coin in coins:
    #get the physical size of the coin
    size = (coin.radius() * 2) * sizeRatio
