'''
This SimpleCV example uses a technique called frame differencing to determine
if motion has occured.  You take an initial image, then another, subtract
the difference, what is left over is what has changed between those two images
this are typically blobs on the images, so we do a blob search to count
the number of blobs and if they exist then motion has occured
