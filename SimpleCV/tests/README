These test files are setup as a way to unit test your code in case you
decide to make changes to the library.

Please keep in mind that not all functionality is tested, but it's good
practice to run these test to ensure the minimum amount of errors.

running the test are very simple but require you to have python nosetools installed.
To install nosetools you can either use:
  sudo easy_install nose
          -or-
  sudo apt-get install python-nose


once these are installed, just run the command
  nosetest tests.py

to run basic functionality test working.  You should get all OK checks
if everything is fine and dandy. But you will get errors if something
is broken.

To run all tests on a local environment, you can use:
  nosetests
The Travis CI default test only covers the basics (tests.py). Please run all the tests in order to ensure that nothing is breaking.
